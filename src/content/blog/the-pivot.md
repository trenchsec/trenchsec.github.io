# From Hard Hats to Hackers

You're probably thinking - another hacker origin story...

Because my path didn't go through computer science degrees or internships. It went through hot sunny South African heatwaves with mid-summer site meetings wearing full PPE! 16 years of understanding construction and how to cost it from the ground up, navigating a mostly male-dominated industry. And don't get me wrong, this industry like most - there are loopholes, systems to exploit, and it's tough. Ask anyone in construction if they'd choose the career again... almost EVERYONE will say never go into construction!!! It's rough out there!

So if you're reading this at 2 AM, wondering if it's too late to pivot, if you've missed some imaginary window...

hi.
Welcome.
Pull up a chair.

## The Seeds Were Always There

Here's the thing about origin stories - they never really start where you think they do.

Mine starts with a jolompy box computer. Cathode ray tube screen. DOS games that required you to actually *type commands* to run. I was the kid who figured out the syntax before figuring out the game.

Then came the video store. Yes, a real video and DVD store - for those of you who don't know what that is, go "Claude" it. At the age of 14, I started part-time and weekend work at Blockbuster Video! I was the one cracking everyone's access passwords and logins. Not for any malicious reasons - I just had to see if I could. Just... curiosity. The lock was there. I wanted to know what was behind it. This taught me some good lessons - people are predictable. Talk to them. Who are they? Do they have pets, kids? Where did you grow up? What school did you attend...

LimeWire era? I was there. Learning how P2P worked by downloading files that were definitely not what they claimed to be (sorry, computer). The dark web? Found my way there too. Dodgy stuff. Purely to say - yes, I've seen how it looks. Not that fancy really... but fascinating.

Reading Neal Stephenson books, Harry Potter, and weird and wonderful texts that helped my mind leave reality and get lost for hours in imaginary worlds!

This was always a hobby. A side quest while life did its thing.

## The Construction Years

Sixteen-plus years in construction. That's not a typo.

I'd see ideas on a large piece of paper - how much will this cost? How long will it take to build? There's something grounding about watching a structure rise from nothing, seeing a 2D concept blossom into a 3D lifelong dream for people who have saved their entire lives to make it happen. (Some not - they're truly blessed.) I learned patience. Problem-solving. How to work with people who communicate very differently than you do. How to work with many people who want yin and yang, how to put out fires, how to keep people happy, and how *not* to implement a complete vocabulary of profanities that go with the trade.

But here's what nobody tells you about finding your thing late: the curiosity doesn't go away. It just... waits.

I enrolled in music production, learnt to use Ableton - understanding genre, soundscapes... how interesting! We have to always be learning, right? Even then I'd always ask "but how does this work behind the scenes?" Damn, the program crashed again. What's causing it? Did my dodgy sample I loaded perhaps do that? Haha.

## COVID Changed Everything

Then the world stopped.

And I thought - if not now, when?

So.....

Every evening after work, every available weekend, every stolen snippet of time. My brain was somewhere else. How does the web work? Understanding the principles of coding (yes, understanding the logic - I'm not a coder... but I need to know what this line does). Reading about exploits. Watching security talks - Jason Haddix, Daniel Miessler, NetworkChuck, Insider PhD, Tyler Ramsbey, TCM Security, HTB, Darknet Diaries, Ciaran Cotter (Awesome blog!), Pliny the Prompter... I can go on for days. As our President says, I thank you!

Going down rabbit holes that led to more rabbit holes. (Loop - Infinity)

I decided I'd learn everything I could about hacking. Not casually. Intentionally. Obsessively. The way my ADD brain does when it locks onto something.

WEB2, APIs. WEB3 (WTAF!). Bug bounty. Offensive security. Defensive security (Extremely Important!). Certifications. Labs. CTFs. So many avenues. So many rabbit holes. And of course AI - (Oh my goodness, Claude CLI - my work husband!)

Here's the secret they don't tell you: the rabbit holes are the point. Every tangent teaches you something. Every "distraction" adds a tool to your kit.

The late evenings? The weekends? Those stolen snippets of time between job sites and life responsibilities? They add up. They become expertise.

## Why Offensive Security?

The answer is simple: how do things work, and how can they be bypassed, exploited, or broken?

Not because I want to cause harm. The opposite, actually. I explore things that ought not to be explored so they can be fixed before someone with worse intentions finds the same cracks.

There's something that resonates about offensive security. Maybe it's the puzzle aspect. Maybe it's the justice element - finding vulnerabilities before the bad actors do. It's kind of like fishing - throw your line in and sometimes you get a bite, sometimes you don't - and it'll drive you mad. You have to keep going until you catch something. Maybe it's just that my brain has always been wired to ask "but what if I tried this..."

## The Lifelong Learner Thing

Here's what I know for sure: this field will never bore me.

Every day there's something new. A new technique. A new vulnerability class. A new tool. A new bounty target, a new rabbit hole. For someone whose brain craves novelty and depth in equal measure, it's perfect.

I'm not at the finish line, in fact I've only just dipped my toes into the waters. I'm not sure there is one. But I'm in the trenches now, doing the work, learning every day, and I'm H00K3D!

And if you're reading this wondering if you can pivot too - from construction, from retail, from whatever path you're on - the answer is yes. The only requirements are curiosity, determination, time and stubbornness. If something really interests you, then the quote goes without saying: "Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life." - Confucius

The rest you figure out in the rabbit holes / trenches.
